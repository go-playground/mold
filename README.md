- To use a comma(,) within your params replace use it's hex representation instead '0x2C' which will be replaced while caching.

Contributing
------------
I am definitly interested in the communities help in adding more scrubbers and modifiers.
Please send a PR with tests, and prefereably no extra dependencies, at lease until a solid base
has been built.
